<p>Welcome, fellow traveler, on a new journey on the internet.</p>
<p>This website will enable you to create a VPN account to use the service.
    <br>
    To control the amount of signups, we currently require you to have an unlock key
    to be able to sign up. If you have not received such a key, and you're willing to do the following</p>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">Use our service</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Provide feedback</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Accept that Neutrinet currently makes no guarantees about the functionality nor security of its 
        service. We are providing a lot of effort to make the VPN stable and as secure as possible, but
        please refrain from using our network for critical applications (webshop, comms provider).</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Have a drink with us! (we're people, too)</li>
</ul>

    us (IRC or mail), and we will likely provide you with one if we still have capacity left.</p>
<h2>Sign up</h2>
<p>You have an unlock key. We are building a great VPN service. Let's do this.</p>
<form action="#" class="form-group">
    <label class="label" for="signup-email">Email address</label><input class="form-control" type="text" id="signup-email" /><br>
    <label class="label" for="signup-key">Unlock key</label><input class="form-control" id="signup-key" type="text" /><br>
    <input class="btn btn-primary form-control" type="button" value="Sign up!" />
</form>
<h2>Unlock key policy</h2>
<p>Neutrinet ASBL keeps the right to hand out and retract unlock keys at its sole discretion.
    We handle ad-hoc requests by following guidelines:</p>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">First come, first serve</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">One key per person</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Unlock keys are valid for 7 days, starting at the date of issuance</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">When re-applying, your request is placed at the end of the queue</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">When using the unlock key with an e-mail address other than the one it has been sent
        to, please allow us some time to verify both email addresses are used by the same person.</li>
</ul>
