    <p>The file you are about to download contains everything you need. Open a terminal, and run</p>
    <code>sudo aptitude install openvpn <br />
        cd [download location] <br />
        unzip neutrinet.zip <br />

    <h3>Supported configurations</h3>
    <p>Currently, we support:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Debian Wheezy (7.5) with OpenVPN 2.3+ (wheezy-backports)</li>
        <li>Ubuntu "Trusty Tahr" 14.04 LTS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Is your configuration not supported but are you willing to extensively test your setup?
        <a href="http://neutrinet.be" title="contact">Get in touch</a>, and we'll
        contact you if we are able to start validating your distro/version.</p>
    <h3>A note about Network Manager</h3>
    <p>Due to oversight and/or neglect, the network-manager-openvpn does not allow
        to configure for PKCS11 modules, used when authenticating with your eID. Multiple bugs reports
        have been posted to solve this by allowing for an additional config file, without any result thus far.<br/>
        Please use the openvpn command directly to work around this problem.
