<h2>Certificate generation</h2>
<h3>Guide</h3>
<p>We'll guide you through the creation of your own keypair, for use with OpenVPN. </p>
<p>Please make sure you understand the following: <br />
    <b>Under no circumstance, you are to copy or move your private key off the system it has been generated on.
        You are also required to make sure the private is kept safely and securely, is only accessible by you and cannot be read
        or altered without your knowledge. Neutrinet cannot be held liable for VPN clients, so please take care.</b></p>
<p>When you think your key has been compromised or you need a key for another OpenVPN instance, you can always go to your account page and easily rekey.
   You can choose to retract a public key at any time, we will take care of the rest.</p>
<p>With that said, let's go ahead and create your keypair and CSR:</p>
<code>
    # Windows users may need to <a href="https://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html" title="OpenSSL binaries">download</a>
    OpenSSL first.<br/>
    # enter the following commands in a terminal or command prompt
    # navigate to directory in which you want your keys<br />
    # remember, this should be a private directory<br />
    # preferably in your home folder and not shared via Dropbox etc.<br />
    cd [directory that will hold your keys] <br /><br />
    # generate your keypair and the certificate signing request <br />
    # take care to certainly include a Common Name (CN) in your request, other fields are <br/>
    # optional yet useful
    openssl req -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout client.key <br/>
    <br />
    cat CSR.csr # paste the contents below
</code>
<h3>Certificate Signing Request</h3>
<p>Open the .csr file and paste your entire certificate signing request in the following text box (including the header and trailer)</p>
<form class="form-group">
    <div id="feedback" style="background-color: #500; padding: 5px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; display: none;"></div>
    <textarea class="form-control" id="csr">
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----</textarea>
    <input class="form-control" type="button" value="Sign certificate" id="get-cert" disabled />
</form>
<h3>Neutrinet CA handling</h3>
<p>Neutrinet's CA is secured as good as possible, but due to bugs in the control stack, OpenVPN or humans,
we may require you to rekey whenever a problem occurs. We will prompt you via email and communicate across
all our public channels, should you not react we will
try other means of communication, with clear and simple instructions on how to rekey (which will mostly involve
download a script and/or program which executes the OpenSSL commands for you and automatically rekeys with our 
management service).</p>
<p>Do not modify your keypair at the request of third parties.</p>
