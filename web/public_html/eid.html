<h2>eID identification</h2>
<p>We are obligated by telco law in Belgium to register data that must allow to correctly identify
    the end users. This step will register this data using your eID. You will be given the opportunity to 
    correct any outdated information later on.</p>
<p class="warning">We need to use a Java applet to do this. We're so sorry, there is no other way.<br/>
    If you're unsure what is contained within the applet, the official source code is at (EID APPLET LINK)</p>

    <li>Date and place of birth</li>
    <li>Chip number (needed when supplying a PKCS11 id)</li>
