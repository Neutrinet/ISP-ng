<h2>Unlocked!</h2>
<p>Now we can get started doing the fun stuff: the setup! We will guide you
through the process of creating a VPN link. There will be *cake* at the end.</p>
<p>Because we care about end-to-end security, we require you to have a key pair,
    by which we can validate and secure the link between Neutrinet and you.</p>
<p>We currently offer two options: </p>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item btn-link" id="use-eid">Identify yourself with your Belgian eID</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Upload a certificate signing request (NOT YET AVAILABLE)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Qu√©</h2>
<p>If you're not familiar with the terms used above, here's a TL;DR summary.
Security depends on knowing that the person you're connected to is the person you 
expect to be connected to.</p>
<p>By having your own keypair, we can trust that when sending data down the VPN link,
you are the actual receiver of that data.</p>
<p>The eID allows us to validate your identity because we trust the issuer, the 
Belgian Government, to issue keypairs correctly (contained within your eID),
and securely. Though we can never be sure of it, as we have no idea if and when 
e.g. intelligence services are able to sidestep security and obtain someone's keypair.
Currently we opt to trust the government.</p>
<p>The other option is to generate your own keypair, which is guaranteed to be 
    secure if no one else is able to access it. We then invite you to give us
    your public key, which we sign to establish a mutual trust. This trust implicates
    that you trust us to identify you, and we can validate your identity.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>eID auth is best suited for roadwarrior configs, own keypair best for fixed
    installations (e.g. on your router)</p>
