<h2>Almost there!</h2>
<h3>Addresses</h3>
<p>We have the following IP addresses available for you. However due to exhaustion
    of the IPv4 address space, we kindly ask you to <b>consider if you need an IPv4 address</b>.
    You can always change your mind and request an IPv4 address (if available) or hand back
    your assigned IPv4 address should you not need it anymore.<br />
    We have plenty of IPv6 addresses available, so you're getting a <b>whole /64 subnet</b>
    by default!
