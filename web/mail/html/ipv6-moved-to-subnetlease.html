<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Due to a recent upgrade of our control stack we needed to reassign your IPv6 address range.<br/>
    We apologize for any inconvenience caused, but it isn't all bad news: your new range has a /56 prefix!
    That means you have 256 /64 subnets to use and abuse.</p>

<p>Your new IPv6 subnet: <b>[% subnetv6 %]</b></p>

<p>When you connect to the VPN, your tun interface will be configured with a /64 prefix, due to some OpenVPN
    peculiarities.<br/>
    It is advisable to use an OpenVPN 'up' script [1] to automatically reconfigure the interface with the correct
    prefix.
</p>

<p>Oh, one small extra: if you just love to create subnets and ran out, we allow you to go to a /48 prefix. <br/>
    You know, <i>65k+</i> /64 subnets. <br/>

    <br/>Not bad.</p>

<p>We will be launching a small web app to manage your subscription on our official 1.0 launch, where you'll be able
    to adjust your subnet.</p>

<p>More to come, <br/>
    Your friendly Neutrinet team
</p>
