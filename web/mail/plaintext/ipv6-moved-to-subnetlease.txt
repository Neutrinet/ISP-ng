Hi there,

Due to a recent upgrade of our control stack we needed to reassign your IPv6 address range.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused, but it isn't all bad news: your new range has a /56 prefix!
That means you have 256 /64 subnets to use and abuse.

Your new IPv6 subnet: [% subnetv6 %]

When you connect to the VPN, your tun interface will be configured with a /64 prefix, due to some OpenVPN peculiarities.
It is advisable to use an OpenVPN 'up' script [1] to automatically reconfigure the interface with the correct prefix.

Oh, one small extra: if you just love to create subnets and ran out, we allow you to go to a /48 prefix.
You know, 65k+ /64 subnets. Not bad.

We will be launching a small web app to manage your subscription at our official launch, where you'll be able
to adjust your subnet.

More to come
Your friendly Neutrinet team
